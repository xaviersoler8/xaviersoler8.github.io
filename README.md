## My Research
Although I am a biochemist, my current work is about statistics, machine learning and computational biology

I'm currently a first year PhD student in the [Dias and Frazer lab](https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/dias-frazer-lab).

I am interested in applications of machine learning and probabilistic modelling in biology. My research focuses on applying different modelling approaches to gain insights into health and disease states, with the ultimate aim of contributing to the field of personalised medicine.

Before starting my PhD, I did my Master's internship in the groups of Alfonso Valencia and Biola Javierre. For my Master's thesis, I worked with single-cell epigenomics data with the aim of elucidating the mechanisms of B-cell differentiation.
